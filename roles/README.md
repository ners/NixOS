## Roles

Roles represent logical groups of [profiles](../profiles) that are commonly used together to fit a configuration's intended use.
A role may additionally configure things that do not naturally fit into a profile, e.g. additional packages.

As with profiles, a role should be minimal and self-contained, as duplicated work should be minimised across configurations.
